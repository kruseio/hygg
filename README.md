# hygg
Simplifying the way you read

## Overview
The goal of this project is to build an ebook and document reader that has a minimal set of features, that make reading enjoyable on a desktop computer.

A large emphasis is on making a minimalistic and distraction free environment for you to easily focus on what is important, the content.

Furthermore we are working on building a seamless experience for reading ebooks but also more generally documents, both on a desktop computer and a tablet or e-reader with a browser.

## Features
- CLI client
  - Converts regular or scanned PDF or EPUB to plain text
  - Justifies the plain text to specified column width
  - Horizontally centers the text
  - Minimalistic less like interactive reader with vim like bindings (still work in progress)
  - Saves progress
  - Cross platform
  - Each component in the CLI client is exposed as a UNIX style utility for easy code reuse in your own open source project

## Quick start guide
### Install the CLI client
```sh
cargo install --locked hygg
hygg doc.pdf
```

for scanned document support
```sh
sudo apt install ocrmypdf tesseract-ocr-eng
```

then use the `--ocr=true` flag
```sh
hygg --ocr=true doc.pdf
```
